# Kernseife

These classes were originally developed by [Oliver Drobnik][o] and hosted on [Google Code][g] - I came upon them while looking for a Cocoa SOAP toolkit that could replace the (rather poorly documented) <tt>WSMakeStubs</tt>, and liked them enough to fork.

The <tt>kernseife</tt> command-line utility generated by this Xcode project does a rather better job of parsing WSDL files _and_ generates code that is iOS-friendly (given that <tt>NSXML</tt> is not available on iOS (only <tt>NSXMLParser</tt> is actually available on iOS 4.x at the time I'm writing this), and the results are easily hackable, so I decided to experiment with them and some (rather crufty) web services I have the (rather debatable) pleasure of using.

Right now there are very few changes - I've mostly fixed some warnings and added lazy handing of SOAP responses as an <tt>NSMutableDictionary</tt> to make it easier to deal with complex nested structure (including a poor man's XPath).

Generated filenames are a bit on the verbose side right now to cope with some peculiarities in the WSDL I have to deal with, but they're easily tweaked.
