# Kernseife

These classes were originally developed by [Oliver Drobnik][o] and hosted on [Google Code][g], and I came upon them while looking for a SOAP toolkit that could replace the (rather poorly documented) <tt>WSMakeStubs</tt>.

The <tt>kernseife</tt> command-line utility generated by this Xcode project does a rather better job of parsing WSDL files _and_ generates code that is iOS-friendly (given that <tt>NSXML</tt> is not available on iOS (only <tt>NSXMLParser</tt> is actually available on iOS 4.x at the time I'm starting this), and the results are easily hackable, so I decided to experiment with them and some (rather crufty) web services I have the (rather debatable) pleasure of using.
